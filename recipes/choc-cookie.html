    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The original chocolate chip cookie recipe came from Ruth Graves Wakefield in the 1930s.</p>
    <p>It is a top recipe today because of its sweetness, chewy texture, and deliciously nostalgic results.</p>
    <p>This is why, almost 90 years later, it is still printed on the back of Nestlé Toll House chocolate chip bags.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped nuts</li>
        <li>2 (7-ounce) bars Nestlé semi-sweet chocolate, chopped into pea-sized pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer on low speed. Add eggs one at a time, mixing until combined. Mix in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Sift flour and baking soda over a medium bowl, stir in salt. Add to butter mixture and mix until combined. Add nuts and chocolate.</li>
        <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of dough on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool slightly before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Note: for best results, refrigerate balls of dough overnight before baking.</h3>
